   I currently work at the <a href="https://canurb.org/">Canadian Urban Institute</a> as a Data Analyst. I studied Human Geography, Computer Science and GIS at the University of Toronto.
</p>
<p>
    Previously, I've interned at <a href="https://thebentway.ca/">The Bentway</a> and <a href="https://www.sodatone.com/">Sodatone (Warner Music Group)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm interested in urban environments, music, fashion, and soccer, particularly in how they interact with technology and digital culture.

    Please reach out to me via email if you're interested in chatting about any of my projects, past experience or to enquire about freelance work.
