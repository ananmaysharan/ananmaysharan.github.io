   I'm currently studying <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/design-engineering/">Design Engineering</a> at Harvard University, a collaborative degree program between the Graduate School of Design and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

   Previously, I worked at the <a href="https://canurb.org/">Canadian Urban Institute</a> as a web developer and data analyst, and interned at <a href="https://thebentway.ca/">The Bentway</a> and <a href="https://www.sodatone.com/">Sodatone (Warner Music Group)</a>.

    I graduated from the University of Toronto with a bachelor’s degree in Human Geography, Computer Science and GIS in 2023.

    Some of my interests include: urban environments, design, music, fashion, cooking and soccer, particularly in how they interact with technology and digital culture.
