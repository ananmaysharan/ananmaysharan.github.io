    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        In my role at the Canadian Urban Institute, I was responsible for the
        development of the Measuring Main Streets platform, a part of the
        Research Knowledge Initiative program from Housing, Infrastructure and
        Communities Canada. 
    </p>

    <p>I worked to architect the platform's structure, as
        well as decide on the core technologies used to develop and host the
        platform.</p>

    <p>
        Working with the wider team, I helped develop an interactive map of
        every main street across Canada, as well a set of interactive data
        visuzaliation tools, case studies and reports. I also worked with a
        graphic designer to develop a visual identity for the platform.
    </p>
